Hello, I am Dragos Crisan and today I will present the utility of the Code Review extention.

First thing first, the instalation process is really easy. All you have to do is go to extentions,
type code review and click on the first option from d-koppenhagen. Then click install. It only takes
a few moments to install and it is ready to use. As you can see mine is already installed.

I will now proceed to the utilisation process.
To use the tool all we need to do is select a portion of the code, right click and search for 
"Code Review: Add Note". WE are now met with an interface for creating the review, where we can
pick a title, category, description and we can select the priority with an easy interface. I will
now create a review as an example. 

We choose the title, for category we have a dropdown, we type the description and choose the color
for our priority.

Title: Error Handling Improvement

Category: Error Handling
Description: The error handling in the receiveHttpHeader method could be enhanced by providing more 
informative error messages for parsing errors or unexpected header formats. 
This would facilitate easier debugging and troubleshooting.

We can also modify or delete the code reviews. This is simplified by the menu provided in the app on the left
where we can see all code reviews with their priority. 

After we are done with the code reviews we can export them through various methods, like html, markdown, 
github, json, etc. 

This tool provides a new method to write code reviews that is easy to use, with an intuitive interface
and with the option to export the code reviews in various formats that are easy to read. 

Thank you for your attention, this was my introduction video for the tool.
