Solve the following problem using the JSP/Servlet technology. 
State information (between web requests) is always stored in a database;
 you may store some state information in cookies/session objects. 
Write a web application for user profile management. Before he can use the application, 
the user must be authenticated or he has the option of creating a new account (i.e. register). 
The profile of a user contains the fields: name, email address, picture, age, home town. 
A user can search the profile database using any of the above fields or parts of a field. 
The profiles resulted from the search are displayed on the browser window: 
the image, name, email address, age and home town.
 Image files need not be stored on the database. A user can also change its profile data.
