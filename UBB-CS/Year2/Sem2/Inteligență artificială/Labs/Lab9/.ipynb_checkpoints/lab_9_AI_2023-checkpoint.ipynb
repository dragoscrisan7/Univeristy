    "# Search spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "For meany problems the search space can be represented as a tree, where each node represents a state or a partial solution of the problem, and each edge represents a possible transition from one state to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "So one form for this tree is when the root of the tree represents the initial state of the problem, and the leaves of the tree represent the final or goal states. The idea is to traverse the tree in a systematic way to explore all possible solutions until a goal state is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree is constructed by applying all possible actions from the current state to generate the next set of possible states. Each possible state becomes a child node of the current state in the tree. This process continues until a goal state is reached or until the search reaches a dead-end.\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of organizing the search space as a tree is that it allows for **systematic exploration** of the search space. This means that the search can be optimized to explore the most promising branches first, which can reduce the overall search time. Additionally, the tree structure allows for efficient pruning of unproductive branches, which further reduces the search space and improves the search time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of problems where the search space can be organized as a tree include pathfinding problems, puzzle solving problems, and game playing problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the Fibonacci sequence --  a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.\n",
