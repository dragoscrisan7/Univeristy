the average size of a 2L bottle is 23.5 in height and 10cm in the diameter of the base of the bottle.
by this we will try to calculate how many bottles we can transport in 1 trip, which cannot be a perfect number since 
the bottles cant always be put in the perfect position to be transported.

this will result us in having approximatelly 22 500 bottles on one level, with the ability to store approximatelly 80 levels
of bottles that would be 1 800 000 bottles in one cargo, which means the 6 000 000 bottles would require 4 trips. 
This is of course keeping in mind that all bottles are 2L and have the average size and height.
Although this seems like it would need 4 trips, I on the other hand believe only 1 would be necesarry. Taking into consideration 
that these are plastic bottles, empty and we only need the material to recycle and it doesnt matter in what shape it comes,
i believe the bottles should be 'pressed' / 'squished' before beeing stored in the cargo. If this is achievable, either through
a press or multiple people working toughether, the water bottles should need only one trip to be transported
