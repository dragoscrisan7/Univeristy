9. Filosophy of the app
The society sort of gave up on having rituals and future goals. We dont have morning routines anymore 
or night routines. Nothing is set at a specific time which makes us live in a continuum without any
direction and without beeing present in what we are currently doing. While the app cant help with
making a routine, it does try to achieve the other side of bringing you back to the present, which
is setting up some goals for yourself and following them and sending yourself encouraging thoughts in the
future for when you think you will hit a hard time while reaching your goals.
