Project Idea:
Our mobile app, called "Future Life," is made to give users a special and happy feeling. 
It's for people who want to create their own goals for the future and send themselves 
cheerful messages that arrive at a set time. The app should be simple and easy to use.

Domain Details (Entity):
The primary entity in our app is "Goals." Each goal includes the following fields:
1. Title: A brief title for the goal.
2. Description: A detailed description of the goal.
3. Deadline: The date by which the user aims to achieve the goal.
4. Privacy Setting: A choice to set the goal as private or public.
5. Mini-Goals: A list of sub-goals or steps to reach the main goal.

The primary entity for our app is "Future Messages." Each future message includes the following details:

Message Content: The encouraging or supportive message that users want to send to themselves in the future.
Delivery Date and Time: The specific date and time when the user wants to receive the message.
Privacy Setting: An option to keep the message private or make it visible to others.
Repeat Option: Choose whether the message should be sent repeatedly or just once.

CRUD Operations:

- Create:
  Users can create new goals with titles, descriptions, deadlines, and privacy settings. Mini-goals can be added to the main goal.

- Read:
  Users can view their existing goals, view details, and check their progress.

- Update:
  Users can edit goal details, including the title, description, and deadlines.

- Delete:
  Users can delete goals they no longer wish to pursue.

Persistence Details:

On the Local DB:
- All CRUD operations are persisted locally for users to access and modify their goals even when offline.

On the Server:
- Create, Read, and Update operations are persisted on the server, ensuring that users can access 
their goals across multiple devices.

Offline Access Scenarios:
- When offline, users can create, read, update, and delete goals. The changes will be synced with 
the server when an internet connection is restored.
