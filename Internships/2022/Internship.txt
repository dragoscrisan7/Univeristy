I wish to start my informatics career at your firm. 
I am eager to learn as much as possible about JavaScript and anything else in the field of programming.


Greetings,

As a student at "Babes-Bolyai" University, Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics,
with a strong base in programming and good understanding of object oriented programming,
I see myself as a good fit for summer internship. Attached you can find a CV.

With regards,
Crisan Dragos
